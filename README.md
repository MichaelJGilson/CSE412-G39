# CSE 412 Group 39 Final Project

This project consists of the following files:
displayCode.js
header.txt 1-3
index.html
parser.py
runme.py

The following code acomplishes the project requirements by accessing our PSQL database directly from python using psycogps2, and then imports it into a table and converts it to an html block via pandas. The table blocks are then parsed into one larger html file, index.html, along with our 3 headers. The JS and runme.py file are responsible handlers that launch the html file into our browser.

## Usage Guide

The simplest way to use the program is in the following steps:

1. Start your PSQL server and ensure that the database is already imported and available for access
2. Run the parser.py script in the command line and wait for it to finish
3. Once finished, you can then double click runme.py to launch the HTML file directly into your browser
